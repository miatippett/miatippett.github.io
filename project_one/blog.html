        <h2>Invasion of Communism</h2>
        <p>Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a 1956 science-fiction horror film, that has many elements pertaining to concerns within society. In the film, people begin to notice something is wrong, as it appears that people randomly start to lack emotion.
            While everyone’s concern is growing, a few characters discover the reason for this suspicious change – seedpods are taking over the town. Members of this society are replaced with emotionless doubles in their sleep. Throughout the film, the
            seedpods are symbolic of soviet communism and distill fear in the viewers by displaying the idea of communism as an internal force. </p>
        <p>Many aspects of the film point to communism, and characteristics of the movie appear to play on American’s fear of communism. During the 1950s, there was fear of a communist community developing in the United States. Invasion of the Body Snatchers
            posed as a possibility of what the future would hold if communism in the United States was not exterminated. During the film, they try to convince people that it is okay if the seedpods take over by saying “There’s no pain. Suddenly, while
            you’re asleep they’ll absorb your minds, your memories, and you’re reborn into an untroubled world. Where everyone’s the same” (Invasion of the Body Snatchers). Unsurprisingly, that line is unsettling to a few of the characters, who do not
            wish to be the same, and wish to think independently. </p>
        <p>While watching Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a quote from Senator Joseph McCarthy came to mind that he said during a speech in 1950, which stated “When a great democracy is destroyed, it will not be from enemies from without, but rather because
            of enemies from within” (McCarthy). This whole idea of communist working from the inside is also present in the film. As opposed to many other fears, where the United States has worried about a group of people from another country, this one
            is different. Here, people in this town are panicking about people in their own community turning on them and developing communist ideals. The pod people serve to represent soviet communism, while the people running away to escape the seedpods
            represent American individualism. </p>
        <p>McCarthy argued that communists were invading institutions in American society. Many elements of what McCarthy said are apparent in the film, with the idea of communism working as an inside enemy. People tried to instill the idea that communists
            did not have feelings and used many tactics such as the red scare to deter people from considering communism. </p>

        <h2>Invisible Man: Action but no Progress</h2>
        <p>The whole premise of Invisible Man is centered around the key principle of the narrator’s “invisibility”. Although he may be visible to the eye, he is invisible to society. Much of what the narrator in Invisible Man feels, regarding his invisible
            identity can overlap with the experience of a Black person in the United States and feeling invisible at places such as universities and neighborhoods. </p>
        <p>If you look up the racial statistics at any prestigious university, you will find Black/African America to be one of the smallest percentages. A heading from The New York Times in 2017 reads, “Even With Affirmative Action, Blacks and Hispanics
            Are More Underrepresented at Top Colleges Than 35 Years Ago” (The New York Times). Even though people have created policies to increase the number of Black people and overall diversity at colleges, the number of Black people continues to be
            minimal. Affirmative action relates to policies created that were aimed to increase diversity and educational opportunities for underrepresented groups in society, but those efforts have not been especially successful. In invisible man, the
            narrator feels invisible at the university. Also, in the factory there is a lot of racial tension between white and Black people, and in many typical scenarios in the novel, Black people are marginalized. </p>
        <p>Neighborhoods are another area where Black people may feel invisible, due to redlining, neighborhoods are largely divided by race. Even though redlining was outlawed, its effects remain. An article from 2018 states “Redlining was banned 50 years
            ago. It’s still hurting minorities today” (The Washington Post). Essentially, redlining is a discriminatory practice, where someone would be denied financial services in certain areas based on their race. This led to a racial divide in certain
            neighborhoods, that continues to be present. Now, if there are few Black people in a predominantly white neighborhood, for example, they may feel invisible and not recognized in their community, just like the narrator of Invisible Man. </p>
        <p>While reading Invisible Man, the reader may feel less connected to the narrator, as many of his characteristics are not described, and his name is not revealed. The whole idea of invisibility can be summed up by what the narrator says in the beginning
            of the novel, “I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me” (Ellison 3). People refuse to see and interact with the narrator in everyday activities, causing him to feel invisible, which is a direct connection to aspects
            of our society, including divided neighborhoods and minorities at universities. </p>

        <h2>No Privacy in Rear Window</h2>
        <p>Rear Window is set in a neighborhood, where all the rooms face into a central courtyard. This design makes for an optimal view of fellow neighbors, who can be found playing instruments together, dancing to the point of obsession, and behaving
            suspiciously. Jeff is the first to notice his neighbor, Lar’s, suspicious actions and as he is intrigued by what he sees, he decides to further capture his observations. Throughout the film, the theme of privacy is explored through Jeff’s
            intentions of peering out his window and observing his neighbors, which can be compared to privacy today, and prompts inquiry around the consequences of limited privacy. </p>
        <p>In Rear Window, privacy is constricted through the use of windows. Neighbors can peer out their room into a room of their choosing, and often see private actions that were not intended to be shared with others. There is not much that can be done
            to gain more privacy. In some scenes, blinds were closed, but the observer can still manage to make out what is going on beyond the blinds. What works the best to prevent neighbors from watching a character, is to turn off all the lights.
        </p>
        <p>In our current society, you are constantly being watched, just in a more indirect way. With the technology and widespread popularity of security cameras and recording devices, someone could constantly be watching you. As a society, we often do
            not pay much attention to just how frequently we are watched. Largely because security cameras are everywhere: in schools, inside stores, guarding the house entrance, etc. People are so accustomed to seeing cameras, that we begin not to notice.
            Here in lies the difference between directly and indirectly observing someone. Security cameras are everywhere, but not all the film is actually watched. Unlike the movie, where Jeff intently watches Lars’ every move in hopes of figuring out
            the case, modern security measures are always collecting evidence, but that evidence is not always investigated. </p>
        <p>One of the reasons Jeff is so involved with watching neighbors is that he had a prior accident that confined him to a wheelchair, so he does not have many other activities he can involve himself with. While lack of privacy can sometimes work out
            for the best, information can also end up in the wrong hands and personal data can be used with malicious intent. People have a right to keep certain aspects of their life private and imposing on that right can lead to mistrust and harm. Just
            like in the movie and in the world today, when privacy is put into question, there are dangers that come with it. </p>
        <p>The concept of privacy is explored throughout the film, with Jeff spending what many characters agree on as an unhealthy amount of time watching people outside the window. After analyzing the actions of Lar, he is convinced he witnessed a murder.
            He then tells a few people about his observations, and some do not believe him, while others are intrigued. Privacy is a present issue, and much of what this movie has to offer related to privacy is a highly debatable topic and may prompt
            people to question the privacy in their own society.

        <h2>Rebel WITH a Cause </h2>
        <p>Rebel Without a Cause, which was released in 1955, follows Jim Stark, who recently moved to a different town and is hoping for a new start by leaving his rebellious tendencies in the past. He makes a few friends, including a boy named Plato, and
            they navigate the challenges of life together. Both Jim and Plato have troubled relationships with their fathers, which demonstrates how significant it is for boys to have male role models in their life, so they are inspired by respectable
            men. </p>
        <p>In contrast to Jim’s parents, Jim wants to be seen as a strong and respectable man. In many ways, he demonstrates this through comforting his friends, who also lack supportive parents. Throughout the film, Plato is often cold. Jim helps Plato
            with the simple gesture of giving Plato his jacket and looking out for him when no one else did. Although it may seem small and unimportant, Jim’s many gestures towards Plato are out of Jim’s genuine desire to be seen as a respectable man
            and help out people he cares about. </p>
        <p>Neither of Jim’s parents are particularly positive influences in his life. Within this dysfunctional family, Jim lacks a male role model, as his father is portrayed to lack courage and he is unable to stand up for himself. Although Jim’s situation
            with his father is far from ideal, he still has a father who is present, unlike Plato. Plato has not seen his parents in a long time, and they are never shown in the movie. </p>
        <p>The rebellious and troubling tendencies of both Jim and Plato can be linked to the absence of a positive male role model in their lives. Beyond what is shown in this film, without a supportive father, boys are at risk of developing problems with
            behavior, emotional stability, and relationships. Additionally, according to Rochester Area Fatherhood Network, “fatherless children are twice as likely to drop out of school”. Both in the film, and in modern society, teenagers without supportive
            fathers are at increased risk of not making the best decisions. </p>
        <p>Unlike the title suggests, there most definitely is a cause for the characters actions in Rebels Without a Cause. The protagonists lack supportive and present fathers, which are statistically shown to increase rebellious nature, and the reigns
            true throughout the film. Even as teenagers grow to be more independent, their parents still play a large role in how they develop into an adult. </p>
